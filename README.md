# Alchemy Code Lab FullStack App Demos

Welcome to Alchemy Code Lab! 

Our students have just finished more than 800 hours of tech career training learning how to harness the FullStack JavaScript capabilities using React and Redux on the Front End with ExpressJS and MongoDB on the Back End (plus a dose of Firebase for realtime communication).

Our emphasis on process, regular testing and immersive lab sessions allow our grads to understand how their coding works and why it does what it does. As the only engineering education in town that serves Portland and Portland only, combined with in-person training by experienced senior software developers, our grads are real contributors. We stay on top of the most used technologies and aim for our grads to evolve Portand's economy and community through the companies they go to work for. [Here is an overview](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RVKZ4wzOLJn5OeIE-94riRoJGLpwLRG1SuBdGY7sedg/edit?usp=sharing) of their syllabus through our Career Track training.

Snakes & Squirrels is a quick bluffing game where players try to find more squirrels than their opponents, while avoiding those sneaky snakes. It's easy to learn, but tons of potential for mind games and deception. Snakes & Squirrels was built using Google's Firebase for the realtime database, React and Redux for the front end, and Express and MongoDB for the back end.
